# Grover's Algorithm with PennyLane 🧠🔍

This repository contains a clean and minimal implementation of **Grover’s Algorithm** using [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/), a quantum machine learning framework built for hybrid quantum-classical computations.

Grover's algorithm offers a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems and is a foundational quantum algorithm in quantum computing.
